if it's been more than 3 weeks, go thru the uuid process again:
- get request to https://www.uuidtools.com/api/generate/v4
- put that uuid into post request to https://wap.tplinkcloud.com
    {
    "method": "login",
    "params": {
        "appType": "Kasa_Android",
        "cloudUserName": "liam.donaher@gmail.com",
        "cloudPassword": "WifiOutlet:808",
        "terminalUUID": "YOUR_UUID_HERE"
      }
    }
- post request to https://eu-wap.tplinkcloud.com/?token=YOUR_TOKEN_HERE
  {
    “method”:”passthrough”,
    “params”: {“deviceId”: “YOUR_DEVICE_ID_HERE”,
    “requestData”: “{\”count_down\”:{\”get_rules\“:null}}” }
  }


PRIORITIES:
- when page is loaded, and first snapshot is created, first get device status and see if the plug is connected. if not, set the current state to disconnected
- HOSTING
    - switch the app.js fetch requests to the actual website domain
- error code -20651 means token expired: get another.
- if flip doesn't come back with a sucess code, then it shouldn't rewrite the database lastflipped



ISSUES:
- two buttons aren't exactly the same width (since they're based on text length and each have different values)
- the setInterval doesn't refreshe every second exactly, so every now and then it'll seem like its skipping a second to "catch up".
