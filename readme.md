hi

I can explain this project pretty well if we're in the same room together, but it's not going function out of the box if you download and run it. Firstly, you'd need to set up a firebase project (and make some directories and documents inside the firebase database) and copy in your config to the firebase.js file in the client folder AND the firebase-controller file in the server folder. and also go thru the controller and change some paths so they can access the documents you set up in firebase. there's a few other crucial things to do as well concerning the KASA api and getting your device IDs, but feel free to reach out if you'd like help.
